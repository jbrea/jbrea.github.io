I am a computational cognitive neuroscientist and machine learning lecturer at <a href="https://epfl.ch">EPFL</a>.

My current research interests include
- computational modelling of episodic memory and mental time travel.
- understanding the loss landscape of neural networks and recovering connectivity from activity.
